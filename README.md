# California 1990 Housing Model

## Libraries
pandas, scikit-learn

## Description
Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression Tree trained on California Housing prices from 1990.  The maximum number of iterations of the boosting process (maximum number of trees) is set to 10000 (and can be changed) to make model practical.  On the test run the model recorded 99.05% accuracy.  You can run the program on your own and get the predictions in csv format.

## How to run program
Run HousingModel.py to run the program.  The maximum number of iterations of the boosting process can be adjusted using MAX_ITERATIONS on line 6.  reply with a "yes" when prompted with "do u want to see predicted dataset?" to get the predicted data in csv format.

###  If you cannot this program on your device
My notebook on research collab is https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FAcsPoBWGarrim0rocoRAJstgJ-zThbk?usp=sharing .  Run the first code cell to run the program.  Feel free to leave a comment.
